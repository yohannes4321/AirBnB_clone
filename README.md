Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

The project employs OOP principles to create a modular and organized codebase.
Entities are represented as objects with defined properties and behaviors.
CRUD Operations:

The project facilitates the core operations of creating, updating, saving, and destroying entities.
Objects can be dynamically manipulated through these operations, enhancing flexibility.
JSON Serialization and Deserialization:

Data is serialized to JSON format for storage and later deserialized for retrieval.
This enables efficient data persistence and retrieval, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Command Line Interface (CLI):

A command-line console is implemented for user interaction with the backend.
Users can execute commands to check and manipulate entities through the CLI module.
